Changes
=======

0.7.1 (2010/06/12)
------------------

- Make it possible to use ``colander.null`` as a ``missing`` argument
  to ``colander.SchemaNode`` for roundtripping purposes.

- Make it possible to pickle ``colander.null``.

0.7.0
-----

A release centered around normalizing the treatment of default and
missing values.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Allow ``colander.Regex`` validator to accept a pattern object
  instead of just a string.

- Get rid of circular reference in Invalid exceptions: Invalid
  exceptions now no longer have a ``parent`` attribute.  Instead, they
  have a ``positional`` attribute, which signifies that the parent
  node type of the schema node to which they relate inherits from
  Positional.  This attribute isn't an API; it's used only internally
  for reporting.

- Raise a ``TypeError`` when bogus keyword arguments are passed to
  ``colander.SchemaNode``.

Backwards Incompatiblities / New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``missing`` constructor arg to SchemaNode: signifies
  *deserialization* default, disambiguated from ``default`` which acted
  as both serialization and deserialization default previously.

  Changes necessitated / made possible by SchemaNode ``missing``
  addition:

  - The ``allow_empty`` argument of the ``colander.String`` type was
    removed (use ``missing=''`` as a wrapper SchemaNode argument
    instead).

- New concept: ``colander.null`` input to serialization and
  deserialization.  Use of ``colander.null`` normalizes serialization
  and deserialization default handling.

  Changes necessitated / made possible by ``colander.null`` addition:

  - ``partial`` argument and attribute of colander.MappingSchema has
     been removed; all serializations are partial, and partial
     deserializations are not necessary.

  - ``colander.null`` values are added to the cstruct for partial
     serializations instead of omitting missing node values from
     the cstruct.

  - ``colander.null`` may now be present in serialized and
     deserialized data structures.

  - ``sdefault`` attribute of SchemaNode has been removed; we never need
    to serialize a default anymore.

  - The value ``colander.null`` will be passed as ``appstruct`` to
    each type's ``serialize`` method when a mapping appstruct doesn't
    have a corresponding key instead of ``None``, as was the practice
    previously.

  - The value ``colander.null`` will be passed as ``cstruct`` to
    each type's ``deserialize`` method when a mapping cstruct
    doesn't have a corresponding key instead of ``None``, as was the
    practice previously.

  - Types now must handle ``colander.null`` explicitly during
    serialization.

- Updated and expanded documentation, particularly with respect to new
  ``colander.null`` handling.

- The ``value`` argument`` to the ``serialize`` method of a SchemaNode
  is now named ``appstruct``.  It is no longer a required argument; it
  defaults to ``colander.null`` now.

  The ``value`` argument to the ``deserialize`` method of a SchemaNode
  is now named ``cstruct``.  It is no longer a required argument; it
  defaults to ``colander.null`` now.

- The ``value`` argument to the ``serialize`` method of each built-in
  type is now named ``appstruct``, and is now required: it is no
  longer a keyword argument that has a default.

  The ``value`` argument to the ``deserialize`` method of each
  built-in type is now named ``cstruct``, and is now required: it is
  no longer a keyword argument that has a default.

0.6.2 (2010-05-08)
------------------

- The default ``encoding`` parameter value to the ``colander.String``
  type is still ``None``, however its meaning has changed.  An
  encoding of ``None`` now means that no special encoding and decoding
  of Unicode values is done by the String type.  This differs from the
  previous behavior, where ``None`` implied that the encoding was
  ``utf-8``.  Pass the encoding as ``utf-8`` specifically to get the
  older behavior back.  This is in support of Deform.

- The default ``err_template`` value attached to the ``colander.Date``
  and ``colander.Datetime`` types was changed.  It is now simply
  ``Invalid date`` instead of ``_('${val} cannot be parsed as an
  iso8601 date: ${err}')``.  This is in support of Deform.

- Fix bug in ``colander.Boolean`` that attempted to call ``.lower`` on
  a bool value when a default value was found for the schema node.

0.6.1 (2010-05-04)
------------------

- Add a Decimal type (number type which uses ``decimal.Decimal`` as a
  deserialization target).

0.6.0 (2010-05-02)
------------------

- (Hopefully) fix intermittent datetime-granularity-related test
  failures.

- Internationalized error messages.  This required some changes to
  error message formatting, which may impact you if you were feeding
  colander an error message template.

- New project dependency: ``translationstring`` package for
  internationalization.

- New argument to ``colander.String`` constructor: ``allow_empty``.
  This is a boolean representing whether an empty string is a valid
  value during deserialization, defaulting to ``False``.

- Add minimal documentation about the composition of a
  colander.Invalid exception to the narrative docs.

- Add (existing, but previously non-API) colander.Invalid attributes
  to its interface within the API documentation.

0.5.2 (2010-04-09)
------------------

- Add Email and Regex validators (courtesy Steve Howe).

- Raise a ``colander.Invalid`` error if a ``colander.SequenceSchema``
  is created with more than one member.

- Add ``Function`` validator.

- Fix bug in serialization of non-Unicode values in the ``String`` class.

- Get rid of ``pserialize`` in favor of making ``serialize`` always
  partially serialize.

- Get rid of ``pdeserialize``: it existed only for symmetry.  We'll
  add something like it back later if we need it.

0.5.1 (2010-04-02)
------------------

- The constructor arguments to a the ``colander.Schema`` class are now
  sent to the constructed SchemaNode rather than to the type it represents.

- Allow ``colander.Date`` and ``colander.DateTime`` invalid error
  messages to be customized.

- Add a ``pos`` argument to the ``colander.Invalid.add`` method.

- Add a ``__setitem__`` method to the ``colander.Invalid`` class.

- The ``colander.Mapping`` constructor keyword argument
  ``unknown_keys`` has been renamed to ``unknown``.

- Allow ``colander.Mapping`` type to accept a new constructor
  argument: ``partial``.

- New interface methods required by types and schema nodes:
  ``pserialize`` and ``pdeserialize``.  These partially serialize or
  partially deserialize a value (the definition of "partial" is up to
  the type).

0.5 (2010-03-31)
----------------

- 0.4 was mispackaged (CHANGES.txt missing); no code changes from 0.4
  however.

0.4 (2010-03-30)
----------------

- Add ``colander.DateTime`` and ``colander.Date`` data types.

- Depend on the ``iso8601`` package for date support.

0.3 (2010-03-29)
----------------

- Subnodes of a schema node are now kept in the ``children`` attribute
  rather than the ``nodes`` attribute.

- Add an ``sdefault`` property to ``colander.SchemaNode`` objects.

- Add a ``clone`` method to ``colander.SchemaNode`` objects.

- Add a ``__str__`` method to the ``colander.Invalid`` exception that
  prints an error summary.

- Various error message improvements.

- Add ``colander.Length`` validator class.

0.2 (2010-03-23)
----------------

- Make nodetype overrideable.

- Add __getitem__ to SchemaNode.

- Fix OneOf message.

- Capitalize node titles.

- Deal with empty strings in String, Boolean, and Float types.

- Introduce description; make title the same as name.

- Remove copy method from schemanode.

- Allow schema nodes to have titles.

- The term "structure" is too overloaded to use for schema purposes:
  structure -> schema node.

- Make Sequence more like Tuple and Mapping (it uses a substructure
  rather than a structure parameter to denote its type).

- Add __repr__ and copy methods to structure.

- Add accept_scalar flag to Sequence.


0.1 (2010-03-14)
----------------

- Initial release.
